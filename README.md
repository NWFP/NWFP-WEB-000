# NWFP-WEB-000
To serve as a placeholder for all ideas regarding the new site for the NWFP - there might be some code there eventually. 

Indeed, as we design and build, the actual code might reside in another repository and there will also be a multitude of repository or Docker containers. 
We need however a repository if we want to transform the draft lines in the PROJECT into Issues and start recording our comments. 

## How we communicate 

There are many channels by which we can communicate - Emails, chats, chats in meetings, chats in channels, and even the ERN (or EFN) 
To reduce stress and confusion, lets agree on an ultimate place where we trace actions that will be summarized here, with appropriate notes in the ERN.
